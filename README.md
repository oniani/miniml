# miniml

A minimal machine learning library using the reverse mode automatic
differentiation - implemented from scratch, with OpenCL GPU support.

TODO:

* Implement all `Tensor` operations to be run on the GPU
* Refactor the `Tensor` class
* Implement a reverse-mode automatic differentiation
* More tests
* Test GPU
* Implement network layers
* Implement a loss function(s?)
* Implement Adam optimizer
